0 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
1 a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
0 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
0 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
1 full of surprises . 
1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
1 a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
0 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
0 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
0 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
0 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
1 henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
1 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
0 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
1 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
0 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
0 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
1 tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written . 
0 it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
0 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
0 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
0 pompous and garbled . 
1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
0 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
1 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
1 mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .

1 a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than " memento " 
0 so-so entertainment . 
0 definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
1 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
1 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .

1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
1  . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
0 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
0 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
0 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
1 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
0 it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
1 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
0 according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
0 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
0 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
0 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
1 it's still adam sandler , and it's not little nicky . and for many of us , that's good enough . 
0 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
1 this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
0 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
0 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
0 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
0 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
1 it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
0 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
0 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
1 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
1 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
0 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
0 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
1 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
0 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
0 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
0 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
0 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
1 coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
1 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
0 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
1 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
0 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
0 one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
1 a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
0 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
0 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
0  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
0 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
1 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
0 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
0 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
1 the pianist is polanski's best film . 
0 the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
1 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another . 
1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
0 it's just not very smart . 
1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
0 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
0 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
1 the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
1 the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
0 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
0 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
0 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
0 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
0 aggravating and tedious . 
0  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
1 polished , well-structured film . 
0 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
1 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
0 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
0 bland but harmless . 
1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
1 all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 
0 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects . 
1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
1 time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
0 nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
0 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 
1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
1 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
0 by-the-numbers yarn . 
0 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
0 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
1 spend your benjamins on a matinee . 
1 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
0 once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
0 a sour , nasty offering . 
0 stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
0 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
0 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
0 the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
0 great story , bad idea for a movie . 
0 everything is off . 
0 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
1 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
1 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 
1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
1 hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
1 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
1 the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
0 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
1 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
1 with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
1 these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
0 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
0 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
1 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
0 a workshop mentality prevails . 
1  . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
0 no surprises . 
0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
0 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
0 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
0 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
1  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
0 cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
0 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
0 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . . 
1 a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
1 one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
0 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
0 cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
0 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
0 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
0 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
0  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
1 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
0 the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
1 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
0 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
0 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
0 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
0 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
1 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
1 i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
0 as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
0 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
0 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
1 first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
1 one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 
0 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
1 it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
1 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
1 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
1 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
0 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
0 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
1 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
0 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
1 if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
0 bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
1 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
0 there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
0 circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
1 an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .

1 y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much .

0 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
0 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .

0 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
0 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
0 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
1 whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 
0 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
1 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .

0 like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
0 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler .

0 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .

1 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
0 the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
1 a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
0 thin period piece . 
0 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .

0 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
0 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
0 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
1 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
0 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
0 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
1 the film is one of the year's best . 
1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .

1 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning .

1 an almost unbearably morbid love story .

0 pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
0 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
1 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
0 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
0 simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
1 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .

1 intimate and panoramic . 
1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
1 hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
0 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
1 a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
0 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
0 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
1 australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
0 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
0 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
0 it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
0 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
0 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
1 lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
1 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
0 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
0 even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
0 it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
1 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
0 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
0 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
0 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
0 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
0 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
0 kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
1 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
1 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings . 
1 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
1 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 
0  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
1 spare yet audacious . . . 
1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
1 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
0 worthy of the gong . 
1 it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
0 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
0 arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
0 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
0 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
0 collapses under its own meager weight . 
1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
0 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .

1 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
1 an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 
0 the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
0 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
0 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
1 moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
1 exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
0 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
0 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
1 like its predecessor , it's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate . 
0 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
0 while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
0  . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
1  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
1 superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
1 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
0 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
1 never once predictable . 
1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
0 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
1 it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
1 morvern rocks . 
0 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
0 yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
1 it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
1 feral and uncomfortable . 
1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
0 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
0 i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
0 where the film falters is in its tone .

1 what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
1  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
1 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
0 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth . 
0 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
0 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
1 expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women . 
1 it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style .

1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
1 [leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
0 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
0 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance . 
0 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic .

1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
0 a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
1 a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
1 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
1 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
0 yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
0 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
0 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
0 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
0 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
0 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
0 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
0 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
1 light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
1 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
0 astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
1 there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
0 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
0 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
0 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
1 graças às interações entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se não apenas uma história divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguição , mas também um belo estudo de personagens . 
0  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
1 as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
1 though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
1 fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
0 arty gay film . 
0 the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
1 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . 
1 it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
0 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
1 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
0 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
0 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
1 austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
1 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
0 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
1 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 
0 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
0 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
0 if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
0 it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
0 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
0 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
0 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
0 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
0 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
0 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
0 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
1 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
0 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
0 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
1 brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
0 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
1 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
1 comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
1 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
0 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
0 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
1 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
0 it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
0 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
0 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
0 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
0 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
1 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
0 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
0 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
1 a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
1 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
1 an original little film about one young woman's education . 
0 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
1 like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
0 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
0 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
0 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
0 i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
0 bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
0 suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
1 this is a superior horror flick . 
0 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier . 
1 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
0 [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
1 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
0 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
1 jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
1 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
1 delightfully rendered
0 demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
0 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
0 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
0 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
0 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium . 
0 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
0 it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
0 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
0 as saccharine as it is disposable . 
0 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
0 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
0 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
0 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
0 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
0 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
0 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
0 a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
0 this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
1 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
0  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
0 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
1 lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
0 the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
0 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
1 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
0 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
0 the movie bounces all over the map . 
1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
1 adaptation is simply brilliant . 
0 comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
0 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
0 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
0 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
1 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
1 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
0 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
0 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
0 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
0 i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
1 mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
0 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
1 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
0 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
1 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
1  " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
1 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
0 a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
1  . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
0 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
0 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
0 doesn't really add up to much . 
0 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
0 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
0 it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
1 garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
0 i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
0 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
0 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
0 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
0 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
0  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
0 who needs love like this ? 
1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
0 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
0 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
0 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
0 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
1 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
0 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
1 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
0 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
0 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
0 so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
0 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
0 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
1 [a] satisfying niblet . 
0  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
0 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
1 it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
1 there's a lot to recommend read my lips . 
0 the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
0 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
0 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
1 the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
0  . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
0 [a] poorly executed comedy . 
0 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
0  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
0 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
1  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
0 i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
0 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
0 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
0 feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
1 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
1 a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
1  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
1 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . 
0 ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
0 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
0 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
0 the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
0 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
0 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
0 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
1 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance . 
0 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
0 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
0 an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
1 a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
1 far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . 
0 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
0 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
1 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on . 
0 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
0 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
0 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
0 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
1 max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished . 
0 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
0 'this movie sucks . '
0 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
0 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
0 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
0 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
0 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
0 if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life

0 schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
1 those of you who don't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original . well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
0 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
0 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
0 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
0 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
1 mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
0 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
1 matches neorealism's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives . 
0 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .

0 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
1 if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
1 it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
0 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
1 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves

0 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
0 parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play .

1 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
0 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
1 we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher .
