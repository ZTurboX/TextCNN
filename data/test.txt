0 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting .

0 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
0 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
0 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess .

0 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
0 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
0 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
0 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
0 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .

0 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‘direct-to-video' release . 
1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
0 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
0 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
0 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
0 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
0 sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
0 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
0 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
0 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
0 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
0 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .

1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
0 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
0 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
0 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
1 if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
1 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
1 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
0 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
0 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
0 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
0 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
0 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
1 [director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 
0 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
0 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
1 exciting and well-paced . 
1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
0 beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
1 in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
0 earnest but heavy-handed . 
0 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .

1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
0 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
0 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
1 y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón
0 lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
1 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0 the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
0 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
0 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
0 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
0 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
1 you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
0 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
0 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
1 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere .

0 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
1 just how these families interact may surprise you . 
1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
0 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
0 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
0 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
0 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .

0 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention .

1 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
0 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
0 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .

0 technically and artistically inept . 
0 it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .

1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
0 too silly to take seriously . 
1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .

1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
0 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
0 dramatically lackluster . 
0 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .

0 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
0  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
0 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .

0 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
0 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
1 duvall is strong as always . 
0 new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
0 a well-crafted letdown . 
0 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
0 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
0 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
1 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
0 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
0 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .

1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
0 an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
0 the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
0 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
0 showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
1 i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons !

0 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
0 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .

0 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
1 it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
1 u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts .

1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
0 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
0 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
0 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
0 we get the comedy we settle for .

1 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
1 although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
1 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
0 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
0 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
0 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
1 the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
0 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
0 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .

1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
0 well-made but mush-hearted . 
0 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
0 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
1 ultimately , " mib ii " succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
1 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
1 nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
0 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
0 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
1 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
0 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
0 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
1 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
0 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
0 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
1 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and lucía] makes for an arousing good time . 
1 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
0 the story itself is actually quite vapid .

1 just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
0 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
0 something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
0 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
1 it's a count for our times . 
0 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
0 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
0 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
0 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue .

1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
1 norton holds the film together . 
1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor .

1 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
0 you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '

1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
0 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
0 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
1 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
0 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
0 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
0 alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
1 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
0 to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
0 about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
0  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
1 quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perdão do trocadilho ) , não há como negar o brilhantismo da argumentação de seu diretor . 
0 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
0 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
0 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
0 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
0 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
0 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
1 a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . 
1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
0 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
0 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
0 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
0 routine and rather silly . 
0 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
0 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
1 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
1 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
0 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
1  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
0 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
1 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
1 has its share of arresting images . 
1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
0 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
1 É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado . 
1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
0 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
1 merci pour le movie . 
0 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
0 some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
0 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
1 there is truth here
0 when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
0 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
0 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
0 even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
1 it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
1 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
1 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
0 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
1 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
1 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
0 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
0 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
0 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
0 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
0 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
0 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
0 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
0 it drowns in sap . 
1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
0 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
1 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
1 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
0 horrible
0 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is…
1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
1 the gags are often a stitch . 
0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
0 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
0 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
0 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
1 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
1 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
0 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
0 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
1 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
0 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
0 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
1 cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
0 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
1 it strikes hardest… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
0 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
0 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
0 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
0 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
0 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
0 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
0 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
0 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
0 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
0 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
0 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
0 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
1 sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
1 triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
0 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
0 it treats women like idiots . 
1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
0 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
0 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
0 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
0 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
0 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
0 a cockeyed shot all the way .
