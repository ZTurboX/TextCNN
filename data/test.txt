0 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
0 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .

1 one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
0 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
0 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
0 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
1 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
1 colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor .

1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .

0 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
0 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
0 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
0 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .

0 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
0 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
0 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
0 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
0 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .

1 affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
0 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‚Äòdirect-to-video' release . 
1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
0 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
0 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
0 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
0 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
0 sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
0 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
0 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
0 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
0 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
0 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
0 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .

1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich√© of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
0 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
0 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
0 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
1 if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
1 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
1 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
0 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
0 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
0 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
0 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
0 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
1 [director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 
0 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
0 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea .

1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
0 beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
1 in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
0 earnest but heavy-handed . 
0 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .

1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
0 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
0 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
1 y tu mam√° tambi√©n es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quiz√° el proyecto m√°s arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuar√≥n
0 lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
1 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0 the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
0 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
0 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
0 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
0 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
1 you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
0 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
0 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0 boy oh boy , it's a howler .

0 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
1 just how these families interact may surprise you . 
1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
0 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
0 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
0 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
0 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .

0 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention .

1 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
0 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
0 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
0 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
0 technically and artistically inept . 
0 it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .

1 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions .

1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .

0 dramatically lackluster .

0  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
0 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .

0 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .

1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift .

0 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
0 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
0 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .

1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
0 an overstylized , pur√©ed m√©lange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
0 the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
0 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .

1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
0 well-made but mush-hearted . 
0 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
0 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't .

1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
1 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
1 nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
0 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
0 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
1 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
0 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
0 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
1 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
0 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
0 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
1 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and luc√≠a] makes for an arousing good time .

1 it's a count for our times . 
0 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
0 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
0 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .

1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .

0 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .

0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
0  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
1 quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perd√£o do trocadilho ) , n√£o h√° como negar o brilhantismo da argumenta√ß√£o de seu diretor . 
0 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich .

1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
0 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
0 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .

1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
0 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
0 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
0 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
0 routine and rather silly . 
0 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
0 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
1 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
1 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
0 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
1  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
0 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
1 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
1 has its share of arresting images . 
1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
0 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
1 √â uma pena que , mais tarde , o pr√≥prio filme abandone o tom de par√≥dia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich√™s que havia satirizado . 
1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
0 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
1 merci pour le movie . 
0 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
0 some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
0 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
1 there is truth here
0 when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
0 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
0 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
0 even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
1 it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
1 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
1 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
0 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
1 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
1 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
0 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
0 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
0 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
0 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
0 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
0 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
0 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
0 it drowns in sap . 
1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
0 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
1 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
1 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
0 horrible
0 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is‚Ä¶
1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
1 the gags are often a stitch . 
0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
0 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
0 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
0 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
1 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
1 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
0 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
0 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
1 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
0 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
0 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
1 cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
0 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
1 it strikes hardest‚Ä¶ when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
0 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
0 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
0 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
0 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
0 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
0 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
0 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
0 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
0 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
0 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
0 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
0 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
1 sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
1 triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
0 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
0 it treats women like idiots . 
1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
0 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
0 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
0 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
0 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
0 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
0 a cockeyed shot all the way .
